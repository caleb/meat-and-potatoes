# meat-and-potatoes

The Meat and Potatoes cookbook is a collection of recipes used in almost every server.

Recipes include:
* ssh_known_hosts: Adds github.com and bitbucket.org to the list of SSH known hosts
* swap: Creates and activates a 1GB swap file at /mnt/swap. Useful for small servers
* sshguard: Installs the sshguard package to protect the server from intrusion
* firewall: Configures the "default" firewall to allow ports 22, 80, and 443
